# FirstGUI-Python
Creating a Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Python can be an exciting experience. I designed my first GUI using Python and Tkinter library. I gained valuable insights into design principles, layout techniques, and programming concepts involved in building a robust and user-friendly interface.
# What I've learned:
- Python can be used to create graphical user interfaces (GUI) using the Tkinter module.
- The Tkinter module provides different widgets such as Label, Entry, Button, and Image that can be used to create a GUI.
- The webbrowser module can be used in Python to open URLs in a new browser tab.
Functions can be used in Python to define a block of reusable code that can be called multiple times within the program.
- String interpolation using f-strings is a concise and easy way to create dynamic strings in Python.
- Error handling is important to ensure that the program behaves correctly when the user inputs invalid data or when there are unexpected errors.
